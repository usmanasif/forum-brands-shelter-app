# Forum Brands Full Stack Application Exercise
***Hi! We are super excited to see what you are able to create***

***Duration***: We don't expect you to take more than 2~4h to finish the exercise.

## The Exercise
You are in the forefront of creating a new internal dashboard for an amazing Shelter. 

This particular shelter only allows the intake of 2 types of animals ***Cats*** and ***Dogs*** both of which can always be adopted
at any stage. 

As an Animal Care specialist I would love to be able to manage different aspects in this application:
- Identify the animal in an easy and intuitive way
- Understand how long the animal has been in the shelter 
- Understand who has adopted our animals
- Be able to change information about the Cat or Dog easily. 

Finally, you overheard the Shelter Manager mentioning that soon there is going to be a new shelter in a new location. 
Not sure what this means now, but probably good to know. 

***What are we looking for***

The following criteria will be used to evaluate your solution: 
- ER diagram
- The application starts and doesn't have any visible errors
- Showcase your skills to us!

***Important to know***

We are not expecting you to create any database or any sql code, though we would like to see how you are thinking about the 
database structure. It can also be a simple image or a readable hand drawing. All the data of the endpoints (Graphql or REST) 
can be hardcoded as a JSON object return.
